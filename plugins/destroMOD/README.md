# H1Z1 Server Plugin Template

This is a template for an h1z1-server plugin that can be used as a starting point for developing custom plugins. It extends the `BasePlugin` class provided by the h1z1-server framework and demonstrates how to override the default behavior of a public function in the `ZoneServer2016` class.

## Getting Started

To use this plugin template, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the h1z1-server framework installed and set up in your project. Refer to the main h1z1-server repository's documentation for installation and setup instructions.

2. Clone and pull this plugin-template repository, and put it into the "plugins" folder generated by your h1z1-server instance.

3. Update the tsconfig.json of the plugin so that the "@h1z1-server/*" path points to your h1z1-server folder so that your plugin can resolve imports.

4. Customize the plugin properties to fit your needs:
   - Update the `name`, `description`, `author`, and `version` properties to reflect your plugin's information.
   - Define any additional properties required by your plugin.
   - Modify the `loadConfig` method to handle loading configuration values from `config.yaml` or any other configuration source specific to your plugin.

5. Implement the `init` method to add your custom logic:
   - Use the `server` parameter to access the `ZoneServer2016` instance and its methods.
   - Override the default behavior of a public function, such as `sendChatText`, by using the `server.pluginManager.hookMethod` method. Customize the logic inside the hook to suit your needs.

6. Compile / transpile the plugin using the `npm run build` command.

7. Build and run your h1z1-server project, and the plugin will be loaded and activated.

## Usage

Once the plugin is loaded and activated, it will override the default behavior of the `sendChatText` function in the `ZoneServer2016` class. Instead of sending the original `message` parameter to the client, it will send the custom `chatTextMessage` property defined in the plugin.

To customize the plugin further, refer to the main h1z1-server repository's documentation, as well as the available classes and methods provided by the server framework.
